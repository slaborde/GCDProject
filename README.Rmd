### To run the script execute the following steps:

1. Set your working directory
2. Clone repo with url: https://github.com/slaborde/GCDProject.git using: git clone https://github.com/slaborde/GCDProject.git </ol>
3. Place the folder "UCI HAR Dataset" with all its files in your working directory
4. Run script in R: source("run_analysis.R")
5. Read the output from file "tidyData.txt": 

using i.e the following code:

* Read the tidyData output
	test_data <- read.table("tidyData.txt", header = TRUE)
	View(test_data)

### Notes:
* Step 4 will take about 15 seconds running and will produce the output file "tidyData.txt"
* The output will be a dataser with 68 columns (subject, activity, the mean of the 66 features) and 180 rows (6 activities per subject with 30 subject so 30 x 6 = 180)
